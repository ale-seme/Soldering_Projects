# Soldering Projects

Welcome to my collection of soldering projects! This repository contains some soldering projects that I choose to do in order to improve my soldering skills. The main goal is also to share insights and my personal journey in this beautiful practice.

## Projects

1. [CAI-269-LED FM Radio](./CAI-269-LED-FM-Radio)
   - Assemble an FM radio kit by soldering the components onto a PCB.
   
2. [SMD Soldering Practice - Open Source PCB](./SMD-Soldering-Practice)
   - Practice surface-mount device (SMD) soldering with an open-source PCB designed for skill-building.

More projects will be added soon!

## How to Use

- Navigate to each project folder to find detailed instructions, component lists and curiosities.
